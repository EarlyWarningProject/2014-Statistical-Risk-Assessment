=================

R scripts for generating statistical forecasts of onsets of state-led mass killing episodes described in this post on my blog, Dart-Throwing Chimp:

The script that does the estimating and forecasting is "cpg.statrisk.2014.estimation.and.validation.R". All of the other scripts are used to generate the data used in that process. All of the data sets used in this analysis are in the public domain and available for free, but not all of them are posted online, and many of the ones that are online aren't posted in a format that's easy to ingest and merge. So, to facilitate replication of the modeling piece, the .csv created at the end of the first section of the estimation-and-forecasting script can be found on my Google Drive here:
